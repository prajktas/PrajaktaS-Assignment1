6.) Sorting Strings
Create a list of strings. Sort them alphabetically. Sort them by length. Sort them by length in descending order.
Advanced:â€¯Sort by length, then sort equal length strings alphabetically
CODE:
package Assignment

def str=["one","twoooo","threeeee"]
println str.sort()
println str.sort { it.size() }   //sorting by length 
println str.sort { -it.size() }  //sorting by length in descending order


//Advanced
def st=["john","mike","jack","michael"]
println st.sort { it.size() }
println st.sort()

OUTPUT:
[one, threeeee, twoooo]
[one, twoooo, threeeee]
[threeeee, twoooo, one]
[john, mike, jack, michael]
[jack, john, michael, mike]
