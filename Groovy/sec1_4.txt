4.) Strings and GroovyStrings
a. How many characters are in the string "Hello, Groovy!"?
b. Define a string variable containing a name. Print a hello statement with your name using string 
concatenation, then using a Groovy string.
c. Demonstrate that "racecar" is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. Do the same with "Bob", 
removing case sensitivity first.
d. Define a string variable containing the sentence, "Hello, World. How are you?". Split the sentence into 
an array using the split method. Count the number of words. Do the same using 
the tokenize method.
e. Using the same sentence, use array notation (square brackets) to print the substring "World".
f. Use array notation to print the last word, but reversed.
CODE:
package Assignment

//a
def str="Hello, Groovy!"
println str.length()

//b
def name="Rags"
println "Hello, my name is ".concat(name)
println "Hello, my name is ${name}"

//c
def str1="racecar"
str2= str1.reverse()
println "$str2 is reverse of $str1. $str1 is a palindrome."

def str3="Bob"
str4 = str3.toLowerCase().reverse()                             //def str4="Bob".equalsIgnoreCase("bob")
println "Reverse is $str4 . $str3 is a palindrome"              //println str4 

//d.split
def string="Hello, World. How are you?"
spl = string.split(/\W/)
println spl
size= spl.size()
space= spl.count("")
wordcount=size-space
//println "The total number of words are size-spaces $size-$space  = "+wordcount
println "Wordcount = "+wordcount

//d.tokenize
st=string.tokenize()
println st
println st.size()

//e
println string[7..11]

//f
println string[24..22]

OUTPUT:
14
Hello, my name is Rags
Hello, my name is Rags
racecar is reverse of racecar. racecar is a palindrome.
Reverse is bob . Bob is a palindrome
[Hello, , World, , How, are, you]
Wordcount = 5
[Hello,, World., How, are, you?]
5
World
